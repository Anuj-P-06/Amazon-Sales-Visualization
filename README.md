### Project Overview
This Tableau project aims to provide a analysis of order data across various dimensions, including time, product categories, courier status, and geographical distribution. By visualizing quantities and sales amounts through bar graphs, line charts, and maps, the project helps identify trends in product demand, shipping performance, and regional sales patterns. The inclusion of top 10 states by quantity and category, along with a map of India, allows for a deeper understanding of how different regions contribute to overall sales and distribution efficiency.
